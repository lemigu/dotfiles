Things I shouldn't forget:
- `CTRL+b c` - create new window
- `CTRL+b <number>` - to swap between windows
- `CTRL+b %` - split side by side
- `CTRL+b "` - split top and bottom
- `CTRL+b o` - swapping between panes (can use arrow keys instead of `o` as well)
- `CTRL+b $` - rename session
- `CTRL+b ,` - rename pane
- `[ -z "$TMUX"  ] && { tmux attach || exec tmux new-session && exit;}` - on bashrc to always start tmux
